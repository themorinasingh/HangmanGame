Step 1:
Define a function for game play, that takes the following input:
- list of random words
- list of hangman stages

Step 2:
- Create a while loop, with condition if remaining lifes are greator then 0
- setup an input function that ask for a letter
- replace the letter if it is in the word, or deduct a life. 
- end the loop, if we win the game or run out of lives

step 3:
we will use an if statement to check if the letter is in the chosen word, if 
it is we will fillthe blank with the chosen letter
